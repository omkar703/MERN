: vscode git 
U -> untracked files
A -> added files or staged files
M -> modified files
C -> commited files

when you make a folder then git did not know any thing about it 
1. so we need to initialize it first
2. so git get permission of that folder so that it can do modified staged ...
3. git can check that which file is on which stage like checkpoint


:: git status -s -> 3
:: git log --oneline --graph -> all commit history

:: rm -rf .git -> remove all git track 


:: git branch name -> create a new branch
:: git branch -> show all branch
:: git switch "branchname" -> switch branch 

for mearge code we need me present at main branch


git staging -> if you are in main branch there you add some content and try to change the branch so at that stage git will give you warning that you cant do that so for drafting that thing use git stash

git stash :> add to stash
git stash apply -> get back your draft
git stash clear -> clear draft

git add . --> add the code to staging step
git commit -m "your commit "
git push -u origin "your branch "
//
merger fetch the commit and branch
git fetch
git mearge

gut push origin main
